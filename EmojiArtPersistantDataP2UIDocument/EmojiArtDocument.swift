    // but usually it is going to return data infact check default returns a blank Data()
    override func contents(forType typeName: String) throws -> Any {
        // Encode your document with an instance of NSData or NSFileWrapper
       // return Data()

    ofType typeName: String?
     which is of type UTI like public.json is UTI or edu.standford.cs193p.art could be a UTI
     i.e. it is a unique identifier of that type
     
     Now we dont really care because we only open one thing o anything we open JSON or emojiArt or whatever is all just a JSON data anyways to us so we dont care about the type
     
     But some apps might open multiple different types they might need to know what type it is in order to successfullt open it or save it
     and that's it this is all we need to do to do an emojiArtDocument we are done
     Now we can use all the API of UI document like asynchronous opening and saving , working over iCloud aautosaving , all that stuff just over for free as long as we implemented this things so lets use all those things back in EmojiArtViewController to replace the places where we  where accessing the file system directly

        // contents as? Data because We dont deal with filewrapper that is Any

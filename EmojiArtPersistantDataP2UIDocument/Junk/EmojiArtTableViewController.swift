     but why aint delete still working because you also have to implement below method
     commit editingStyle either delete or insert you have to commit that , that means you have to commit it to your model
     So it is really easy to do it has
     if .delete or if .insert
     this insert is kind of a UITableView for adding we dont need that because we have a plus button

/*
 When we add buttons to top areas of a navigation controller
 we dont add regular buttons
 It will let you do it but dont do it
 
 You put barButton
 because its in a little navigation bar at the top  that's the button you want
 you get all kind of messed up if you use the wrong button there
 
 there are some predefined buttons up there like a camera , like save  , and there also a add
 And I strongly recommend using one of these predefined one's if it describes what you are doing because user will be used to that icon or that image doing what you expect right there
 
 Normal this just a normal bar button and we can just ctrl drag to it to create an outlet

/*
 Currently we where unable to swipe tableview i.e. master of splitView away
That's because this app thinks we are in landscape mode on an iPad
 of course this master and detail are side by side but since we are in multitasking mode so much of our screen is taken up with safari over on right that's its annoying because we really want to focus on EmojiArtDocument
 So lets make it so that the splitView on the left can be slid out of the way even in the splitView in landscape mode
 
 It's quite easily though splitView has a var property called "prefered display mode"
 and you can control what happens with the master through that and it's just that the defualt here is not what we want
 
 So we gonna set this thing in our master
 And we will set it in viewWillLayoutSubviews
 Wow that seems weird place to set there
 the reason i am gonna set there is because when the layout changes of a splitView it often  resets the prefered mode
 So I am gonna keep enforcing master being slide on top mode I am have to keep telling it to do that
 But i am also have to careful because setting that prefered mode can cause it to relay out, So i dont want to end up in an infinite loop here
 where in layoutSubviews preferred mode it's causing layout i am coming back in
 if splitViewController?.preferredDisplayMode != .primaryOverlay{
 splitViewController?.preferredDisplayMode = .primaryOverlay
 }
 
 primaryOverlay will keep it enforcing everytime even everytime we rotate or i am keep forcing it because I always want this tableView to be appearing on top of my EmojiArtView but I also want it to swipe it out of my way

    @IBOutlet weak var label: UILabel!
    
    // I am not putting in any other code in here but I could it would not be unreasonable to put a bunch of logic in your cell if you have logic thats per cell then putting it here can put lot of sense
    // Just because this 1 only has a outlet it's a very simple cell it doesnt mean you couldnt put any other code in there
    // I dont want you to get the idea these are only outlets bags they could have logic in them if that make sense as well

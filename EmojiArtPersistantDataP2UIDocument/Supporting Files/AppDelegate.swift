/*
 Making Files app kind of UI and to do that and make that easy make it simplify our existing code we need to use UIDocument
 
 UIDocument encapsulates aa document in this really beautiful way we have raelly nice API
 We could just do that here all
 I have to do is create UIDocument subclass and Implement 2 methods
 But this is where we are gonna step in and use that template
 And throw that template for document base
 
 
 DocumentBrowserViewController that looks like the files app in iOS 11
 and we arrive into the app there

 and then there is
 EmojiArtViewController we gonna delete default ViewController
 
 Cool thing about storyboard is you can copy and paste from 1 storyboard to another
 Because all the connection to the code are made by name
 So only the names
 So as long as the names are the same then both place it works
 
 
 There's no segue over here So that's why we have to do manual presenting over here

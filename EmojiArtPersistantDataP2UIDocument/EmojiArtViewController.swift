/*
Some people say if you put an extension here EmojiArt.EmojiInfo you have just added UI to your model
 No this is my controller now the fact that my controller is implementing this as in part of extension
 This extension lives in my controller and thats perfectly legal to do
 And you will see iOS do that like something like NSAttributedString which is aactually in Foundation not a UI thing
 but when you start adding font and stuff like that now it start becoming UI Thing
 all that stuff is implemented in UIKit by extension NSAttributedString , they are doing the same thing over there

 So I decided to do it with intializer instead of adding new function
 It initializes it with label

         So how do we do autosave the only thing that's important with autosave is that you tell the UIDocument that something is saved otherwise it's not going to waste its time AutoSaving something that hasnt changed and you do that by
         first telling the document to look at your model
         and then you tell your document that a change has happened

        /*
         Now this is strange that we are saying and noting that our document changed because the user pressed the Save button , that is weird
         Really we should know when its changed when anything changes
         Someone dragged out another emoji they resized it , they put a different background URL that's when we should save
         And really this method shouldnt even be called save it should be called documentChanged
         (***)Document Change tracking isnt put
         But its an interesting thing because that's being tracked in your view
         Well view is what knows when we have resized something or dragged something in so our view needs to talk back to our controller and say hey something changed
         well it cant talk back to our controller expect for blind and structured
         So how do we talk back from our view to controller to tell hey this document has changed ?
         Lets try delegation the same way the tableView talks back to its controller it is a delegation
         ScrollView it uses delegation that's how we would have to do it
         So we would have to set up our own delegation where we have our emojiArtViewDelegate
         That's what we would
         
         I dont want you get the idea to have save button in document apps
         you should never have a save button , it should know when things change and just call this updateChangeCount to autosave it
         
         
         Since we dont have that we will have our save button and we will just tell it when it saves
         
         
         
         
         How about closing our document ???
         Right now we have only 1 document untitled.json but we are just about to add a file chooser taht's lets us choose lots of different documents
         
         So we need a way to close this document so we can open another document
         So we gonna go back and add a close button to our UI

        /*
         The other thing we are gonna do is We will save because we dont have automatic changed tracking I wanna save before I close
         If I had automatic changed tracking I wouldnt do save here I would just delete line of code for save
         
         Notice I did save with no arguments because save takes a bar button item and I dont have one
         here's a cool trick I  am gonna make

 Done with maaking existing app work with UIDocument
 So UIDocument is doing all stuffs that FileSystem was doing for us
 But using UIDocument we can have our app launch show the file choosing thing , file broswer thing like files app
 removing viewDidload because we are not setting the  document = EmojiArtDocument(fileURL: url)
 because we want to set it to the whatever the document the user chooses
